# Agent Instructions

These instructions apply across Website Revenue Leak Auditor.

## Product and safety invariants

- Audits are read-only and intended for sites the operator owns or is authorized to assess.
- Preserve URL validation, DNS checks, redirect restrictions, request timeouts, page-count limits, response-size limits, and same-host scope.
- Never turn static HTML heuristics into claims about actual lost revenue, conversion lift, or user behavior without analytics evidence.
- Do not present a 404/5xx observation as permanent; describe it as an observation at audit time.
- Respect the documented DNS-rebinding limitation: this version is not a hosted arbitrary-URL scanning service.

## Repository map

- `src/revenue_leak_auditor/`: URL safety, HTTP fetching, HTML checks, scoring, report rendering, and CLI.
- `tests/`: mocked network and detector regression tests.
- `docs/SECURITY.md`: canonical security model and operational limitations.
- `docs/visuals/`: explanatory diagrams; implementation and tests remain authoritative.

## Working rules

- Read the canonical security model before changing URL fetching or redirects.
- Validate user-controlled URLs before any network request.
- Do not inherit environment proxy settings or follow redirects without revalidating policy.
- Keep crawl/page/response/time limits explicit and bounded.
- Avoid tests that scan arbitrary real targets. Use mocks or sites explicitly intended for testing.
- Distinguish observed facts from detector interpretation and business impact.
- Never state that the auditor measured conversion, sales, or lost revenue unless such data is explicitly ingested and validated.

## Validation

```bash
python -m pytest -q
revenue-auditor --help
python -m compileall -q src tests
```

## Change ownership and proof

- Keep one authoritative owner for each domain rule and each persisted state. UI, CLI, MCP, and provider adapters translate inputs and outputs; they must not reimplement business policy or become competing sources of truth.
- Before changing a contract, trace the input through its owner to every consumer. Update callers, schemas, examples, docs, and regression tests together. Remove superseded paths unless a documented public-compatibility requirement keeps them.
- Keep optional external model/provider integrations behind adapters. Use injected or mocked adapters for deterministic unit tests; label live network/provider checks separately and never describe a mock as live verification.
- Validate untrusted user, model, file, and network data at the boundary. Preserve the product's evidence/provenance rules and reject malformed inputs rather than silently inventing defaults.
- Verify the supported user entry point and at least one relevant failure path. Report exact commands and results; CI on a different commit SHA is not proof for the current change.
- Keep the root README as the user entry point, `docs/README.md` as the documentation map, and focused guides as the owners of detailed contracts. Update links when files move. Do not hand-edit generated output when a source or generator owns it.


## Repository automation rules

- Treat files under `.github/workflows/` as production code. When changing a workflow, inspect the triggered run for the exact commit SHA; a prior green run is not proof for a newer commit.
- Pin third-party GitHub Actions to full 40-character commit SHAs and keep the upstream release tag in a trailing comment. Do not replace a pinned SHA with a floating major-version tag.
- Use the least-privilege `permissions` block. Default to read-only; grant write access only to the specific job that must publish or commit generated output.
- Give every job a finite `timeout-minutes`. Add a clear `concurrency` group for expensive or supersedable work; cancel stale pull-request runs, but do not cancel workflows whose purpose is to publish a completed artifact or evidence.
- Keep workflow logs and uploaded artifacts free of secrets and personal data. Set retention to the shortest period that still serves the evaluation or debugging purpose.
- Rely on the existing Dependabot configuration for action updates, then review release notes and run the affected workflow before considering the update complete.
